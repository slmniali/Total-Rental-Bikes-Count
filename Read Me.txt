Abstract:
This project developed a linear regression model to predict the hourly rental bike count based on weather, seasonal, and temperature factors. The model was trained on two years of hourly rental data from 2011-2012, using features such as temperature, humidity, month, hour, and day of week. Dummy encoding was applied to the categorical variables of season, weather situation, month, hour, and day of week. Data was split into %90_%10, 657 days of training set, and a test set representing the final 73 days. The linear regression model achieved an R-squared score of %62.1 on the test data. This indicates that the model explains a good proportion of the variance in rental bike counts. The predictions on the test set were summed to obtain a total predicted rental bike count of 395015.76171875. In conclusion, the linear regression model utilizing weather, seasonal, and time information provides good performance in modeling and predicting hourly rental bike counts. The features selected capture relevant information that influence the usage patterns. With further refinement, this model can be leveraged to forecast demand and assist in resource allocation for bike rental services.
